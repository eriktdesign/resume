## PROJECTS

### *Lead Developer*, [The Navigators](https://navigaors.org) (??? — Present)


This website utilizes multiple custom post types and page templates to allow for the client to showcase their content. I built a custom integration between the website and the client’s Human Resources software using the WordPress REST API to create a directory for the over 3,000 worldwide staff. Another integration allows for a map showcasing their hundreds of global ministry locations. Combining custom integrations with off-the-shelf plugins meant I was able to save weeks of development time while still meeting the client’s needs.

### *Lead Developer*, [Feed the Children](https://feedthechildren.org) (??? — Present)


An extensive collections of custom post types and page templates allow for users to dynamically explore the causes of hunger, learn about Feed the Children’s programs, and take action in ending hunger. It was important in this project to craft user interfaces not only for visitors to the website, but also the Feed the Children staff. By building intuitive customized backends, this complex website is able to be managed by the marketing staff without involving the IT team or outside contractors.

### *Project Lead*, [St. Peters Lutheran](https://stpeterslutheran.org) (??? — Present)


As the project lead, developer, and designer, I performed an audit on the existing website. While it was running on WordPress, the commercial theme the site was running on was simultaneously too complex for staff to use, and also too limited in functionality. The architecture of the site also needed help, and a complete restructuring was completed to better organize content for visitors. A dynamic homepage brings users into the various areas of St. Peter’s ministry. For church staff, updates to this page are simple, with a simple backend interface. The restructured architecture simplifies the website down to a few short menu items to allow visitors to better explore the offerings of the church.

### *Project Lead*, [SoundFaith Plugin for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/soundfaith-embed) (??? — Present)


This plugin became the un-official official plugin for Faithlife Sermons, an audio/video hosting site for church sermons. The plugin was developed for the easiest possible embedding of individual sermons or playlists in user websites. The plugin utilizes WordPress best practices to provide a superiour user experience to the official plugin that was contracted by Faithlife. The plugin is in the process of being acquired by Faithlife.
