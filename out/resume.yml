    title: 'The Navigators'
    category: 'Website Development'
    url: 'https://navigators.org'
    role: 'Lead Developer'
    summary: 'This website utilizes multiple custom post types and page templates to allow for the client to showcase their content. I built a custom integration between the website and the client’s Human Resources software using the WordPress REST API to create a directory for the over 3,000 worldwide staff. Another integration allows for a map showcasing their hundreds of global ministry locations. Combining custom integrations with off-the-shelf plugins meant I was able to save weeks of development time while still meeting the client’s needs.'

It was important in this project to craft user interfaces not only for visitors to the website, but also the Feed the Children staff. By building intuitive customized backends, this complex website is able to be managed by the marketing staff without involving the IT team or outside contractors.'

    role: 'Project Lead'
    summary: 'As the project lead, developer, and designer, I performed an audit on the existing website. While it was running on WordPress, the commercial theme the site was running on was simultaneously too complex for staff to use, and also too limited in functionality. The architecture of the site also needed help, and a complete restructuring was completed to better organize content for visitors. A dynamic homepage brings users into the various areas of St. Peter’s ministry. For church staff, updates to this page are simple, with a simple backend interface. The restructured architecture simplifies the website down to a few short menu items to allow visitors to better explore the offerings of the church.'
